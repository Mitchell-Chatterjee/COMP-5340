To activate the conda env use:
	- conda activate syft_env

If you have Pycharm, this is how to link your WSL environment:

Ideas:
	- What about adding noise to bring the data in each device closer to the average as the model converges.
	- There are no learning algorithms that currently penalize you based on how biased your data is.
		Weighting the update of a model based on some metric of bias.

	- ***
		Adding noise for unbalanced datasets using a GAN or VAE or pgd

		Essentially we aggregate the values of each class per dataset and then we train a GAN
		to generate more data from these datasets which we then add back to the datasets themselves.
